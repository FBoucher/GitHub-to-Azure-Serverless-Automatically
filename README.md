## Session Abstract

Azure Function and Azure Logic Apps are part of the Serverless offer from Microsoft cloud Azure. But why should you care about serverless? What's an Azure Function or Azure Logic Apps? And can you create a continuous integration and continuous deployment solution for it? This session will answer all those questions and with demos helps you to be ready to deploy your first serverless solution to Azure.
